                    Happy 22nd birthday to the most beautiful and amazing person in my life! Even though I can’t be with you in person today, my heart is right there celebrating with you. Distance can’t dim the light you bring into my life or the love I feel for you. Your kindness, strength, and that radiant smile of yours inspire me every day. Turning 22 is such a beautiful milestone, and I know this year will bring you even closer to your dreams. You’re just as stunning and special as the day we first met, and I can’t wait to make up for the moments we’re missing now. Here’s to you, my love always shining bright, no matter where we are.
